# Project Placeholder
Exciting. Intriguing. Not a real project.

## A place to try out collaborative working on GitHub

Rather than find out on the day that we have problems with using branches or pull requests or code reviewing, this is a place to try things out and establish guidelines on how we will work as a team. This readme is a work in progress which everyone should feel free to edit and add to (subject to every change being peer reviewed by another member, for practice).

## Tasks

Add to this list as we find out what we need. Edit any sections that are incorrect or could be more clear.

1. Clone this project to your machine.
1. Make a new branch.
1. Make a change (maybe a new file or a new section here in the readme).
1. Push that branch (not master) to this repository on GitHub.
1. Make a pull request to merge your branch into master on GitHub.
1. Respond to the reviewer's request for changes.
1. Merge your branch on GitHub into master once approved.
1. Review at least one other member's pull request, asking for at least one change for practice.

Some of the settings may need to be changed if any of these turn out to not work.

Ask each other if you have any questions about how to do any of this or whether the process should be changed. Add further sections if required. For example, the first step "Clone this project" is a link to a heading below:

### Cloning this project

Instructions to be added here.
